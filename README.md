### About :
> Stock Management System is a software system for tracking inventory levels, orders, sales and deliveries. 
  It can also be used in the manufacturing industry to create a work order, bill of materials and other production-related documents.
  Companies use stock management software to avoid product overstock and outages. It is a tool for organizing inventory data that before
  was generally stored in hard-copy form or in spreadsheets.
